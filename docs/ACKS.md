# ACKs: diagnosing hardware auto-ACK and retry

## ACK feature model (proposed glossary)

Four features that `use_no_ack` / `ack_detect` had been conflating. Names are proposals for the
redesign; the hardware behaviour is measured in the two tables below.

- **A. RX ACK Admission** (`enable_rx_acks` / `disable_rx_acks`; today `enable_ack_detect`): the RX/MAC
  filter setting that lets ACK frames (FC=0xD4) reach our RX feed. Receive-side only; `record_ack` needs
  it on. Register-driven cards flip a bit (Realtek RXFLTMAP1 / MediaTek MT_RX_FILTR_CFG); monitor-mode
  cards already admit ACKs.
- **B. HW ACK-Retry** (the `use_no_ack` descriptor knob): a TX-descriptor setting to expect the
  recipient's ACK and retransmit up to N times if absent. Fire-and-forget, no landing report to
  software. Measured in "HW ACK-Based Retries" below.
- **C. SW ACK-Detection** (`record_ack` + `inject_frame(wait_for_ack)`): software sets `_tx_mac_address`
  to the injected Addr2, sends, watches RX for an ACK to that Addr2, resends up to `max_resends`, and
  returns whether it landed. Works under spoofing. Requires A.
- **Active Monitor** (`enter_active_monitor`): writes a (spoofed) MAC into the card's MAC register so the
  hardware auto-ACKs frames sent to it. Measured in "HW Auto-ACK" below.

## ACK Lab Scripts

Two bench probes in `scripts/ack/`. Each script's module docstring covers what it measures and how.

`tx_retries.py` -- does the card's hardware retransmit an injected frame until the target ACKs?

    uv run python scripts/ack/tx_retries.py --inject-card 8812 --target <BSSID> --channel 1

`rx_autoack.py` -- does the card's hardware send an ACK for a frame addressed to it? No AP needed.

    uv run python scripts/ack/rx_autoack.py --test-card 8822 --channel 1

Every control returning ~0 is what validates a run.

## HW ACK-Based Retries -- comparison (bench, 2026-07-16)

Does the card's hardware stop retransmitting an injected frame once the target ACKs? Median on-air
copies per inject: "real AP" answers (lower = it stopped sooner); "dead target" never answers, so its
count is ~1 + the retry limit (AM state does not change it; sniffer loss makes it a slight undercount).
A row with only a 2G figure is a 2.4 GHz-only radio.

| card | stops on the target's ACK? | real AP (AM off) | real AP (AM on) | dead target (retry limit) |
|------|----------------------------|------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| RTL8812AU  | yes, keyed on Addr2 | 2G 1, 5G 3 | 2G 1, 5G 1 | 2G ~41, 5G ~49 |
| RTL8814AU  | yes, keyed on Addr2 | 2G 1, 5G 1 | 2G 1, 5G 1 | 2G ~13, 5G ~13 |
| RTL8821AU  | yes, keyed on Addr2 | 2G 1, 5G 1 | 2G 1, 5G 1 | 2G ~42, 5G ~49 |

| RTL8188EUS | yes, keyed on Addr2 | 2G 1 | 2G 1 | 2G ~13 |
| AR9271     | yes, keyed on Addr2 | 2G 1 | 2G 1 | 2G ~8 |
| MT7612U    | yes, needs active monitor | 2G 11, 5G 16 | 2G 1, 5G 1 | 2G ~13, 5G ~16 |

| RT5370     | yes, needs active monitor | 2G 7 | 2G ~2 | 2G ~8 |
| RT5372     | yes, needs active monitor | 2G 7 | 2G 1 | 2G ~8 |
| RT5572     | yes, needs active monitor | 2G 7 | 2G 1 (5G: no ACK seen) | 2G ~8, 5G ~8 |
| RTL8187L   | only its own silicon MAC | silicon 1, spoofed 5-6 | N/A (no AM) | ~6 |
| RT2500USB | yes, keyed on self-MAC [1] | 2G 1/~15 (ack=off/on) | 2G 1 | 2G 1/~15 (ack=off/on) |

RT3572 (rt2800usb) is omitted from this table: its unburned-EFUSE TX is too weak to elicit AP ACKs, so
its retry behaviour is unmeasured. Its auto-ACK still confirmed it SPOOFABLE (see below).

[1] RT2500USB corrected 2026-07-19. The original "no, ignores ACKs / 2G ~14 / ~16" was wrong the
self-MAC register (MAC_CSR2/3/4) never programmed.

The stop-on-ACK match splits by chip vendor. Realtek (8812 / 8821 / 8821cu / 8822 / 8814 / 8188eus) and
Atheros (AR9271) key on the frame's own Addr2, so they stop without active monitor: both columns are ~1
on 2.4 GHz, and on 5 GHz AM-off runs at most a copy or two above AM-on (8812au 3, 8822bu 2). The MediaTek
and Ralink family (mt76x0u / mt76x2u / mt7921au, rt3070 / rt5370 / rt5372 / rt5572) keys on the source
MAC only once active monitor registers it: AM off ignores the ACK and retries to the limit, AM on
collapses to 1. The 8187 keys on its own silicon MAC only. The RT2500USB ships ack=False (one copy, no
retries); the silicon could stop-on-ACK if the self-MAC were programmed, but no shipped code does that
(note [1]). (The 7921's old "fixed count regardless" label was just its AM-on pass being skipped when
FAKE_MAC was mis-flagged UNIMPLEMENTED.)

## HW Auto-ACK -- comparison (bench, 2026-07-16, n=100)

Does the card's hardware answer a frame addressed to it with an ACK? Numbers are ACKs counted back per
100 injected frames; controls (active monitor OFF, bogus MAC) were 0-1 in every run.

`FAKE_MAC` flags reconciled against this bench:
- **MT7921AU** was flagged `UNIMPLEMENTED`; it auto-ACKs a spoofed MAC on both bands (not its own
  silicon MAC), so it is now `SPOOFABLE`. [fixed]
- **MT7612U** auto-ACKs a spoofed MAC AND its own silicon MAC (the silicon-MAC ACK is where it differs
  from the 7921); already flagged `SPOOFABLE`, which stands.
- **RTL8187L** was flagged `NONE`; it auto-ACKs its own silicon MAC (not a forged one, and it has no
  active monitor to program one), so it is now `FIXED_MAC`. Re-confirmed on the bench 2026-07-16:
  injecting as the silicon MAC stops on the AP's ACK (median 1 copy), a spoofed source never does
  (median 5, its ACKs ignored). [fixed]
- **AR9271, MT7610U, RT3070, RT5370, RT5372, RT5572, RTL8188EUS / RTL8814AU / RTL8821AU / RTL8821CU
  (DKMS)** were already `SPOOFABLE` and the bench agrees (spoofed auto-ACK via active monitor, plus
  silicon-MAC auto-ACK where it could be read); no flag change. Their TX stop-on-ACK family is in the
  retry table above (the Realtek and Atheros cards key on Addr2; the MediaTek mt76x0u / mt76x2u and the
  Ralink rt30xx / rt53xx / rt5572 need active monitor). Two notes: the missing-seq-stamp bug (every
  inject left seq 0, folding the retry histogram into one bucket) hit mt76x2u, mt76x0u, rt5572 and
  rt2800usb, each now fixed to stamp an incrementing seqctl; the 8821cu came up warm so its silicon-MAC
  auto-ACK was not read (spoofed auto-ACK confirmed on both bands).
- **RT3572 (rt2800usb driver)** auto-ACKs a spoofed MAC and its own silicon MAC (103 / 102 per 100), so
  `SPOOFABLE` is confirmed. The one test unit has an unburned EFUSE, so its injected TX is too weak to
  reach the AP (0 ACKs back on every scenario): its retry family is unmeasured, not inferred. Its inject
  carried the same missing-seq-stamp bug, now fixed.
- **RT2500USB** stays `NONE` on the auto-ACK (emit) axis, confirmed and root-caused 2026-07-19: it does
  not auto-ACK even its own silicon MAC (0/100), and re-testing with MAC_CSR2/3/4 programmed still gave
  0. Root cause: the RT2570 has no `AUTO_RSP_CFG` (autoresponder enable) and no `UNICAST_TO_ME_MASK`.
  Its ACK emission is coupled to the RX address filter (TXRX_CSR2 `DROP_NOT_TO_ME`), which monitor mode
  must clear to receive foreign frames, so the responder never fires.

Scope: the mainline (non-DKMS) Realtek variants (rtl8188eus, rtl8812au, rtl8821au, rtl8822bu) and
rtw88_8814au stay `UNIMPLEMENTED` by choice: active monitor was never ported for them, so they are out
of scope for this sweep, not regressions. The bench targets the DKMS drivers we ship.

`enter_active_monitor`'s `bssid` is read only by rtl8922au, mt7921au and mt7925au, and is inert on all
three: same auto-ACK with and without it, confirmed against a real AP (2026-10-07). The mt7921au and
mt7925au docstrings claiming the AP's frames need it are wrong.

Note on the retry histogram: the tx_retries per-inject copy count is only valid once each inject
carries a distinct 802.11 sequence number. The MT76 chips transmit the MPDU's seq_ctrl verbatim, so a
driver that never stamps one sends every inject as seq 0 and the sniffer folds a whole run into one
bucket. mt7921au already stamped (tx.stamp_seq_ctrl); mt76x2u did not until 2026-07-16, so its numbers
here are from the post-fix build.
